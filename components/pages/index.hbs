        I am an experienced digital media and production professional currently working as a Front-End Developer for <a href="http://digital-detox.co.uk" target="_blank">Digital Detox</a>, a Web Development agency based in South London. Primarily using HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT. I love the web and In my spare time I have also created websites for my theatre company <a href="http://velvettrumpet.co.uk" target="_blank">Velvet Trumpet</a>, <a href="http://3dux.co.uk" target="_blank">3DUX</a> and <a href="http://idcreativemedia.co.uk" target="_blank">ID Creative Media</a> amongst others. My expertise pan to film and television where i was able to create post-production VFX using After Effects to  <a href="http://rathergood.com" target="_blank">Rathergood.com</a>'s productions <a href="http://" target="_blank">Uncle Wormsley's Christmas</a> and <a href="http://" target="_blank">Ship of Eagles</a> as well as HARK's music promo for <a href="http://" target="_blank">Scarlett Extremeties</a>.

          Before my work at Digital Detox, for three years I leveraged and honed my technical expertise using Adobe CS and Developer skills (HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, Actionscript) on key projects at <a href="http://framestore.com" target="_blank">Framestore</a> in their Design and Digital portfolio. A rewarding experience spanning interactive, VFX, motion graphics, titles and credits, and motion capture. Highlights include building British Airways’ “Take a Plane Down Your Street” web/Facebook app, which has been said to be <q cite="Mail%20On%20Sunday,%2023%20June%202012">The most successful social media app ever</q> (Mail On Sunday, 23 June 2012), titles and end rollers for the film “Tyrannosaur”, and working on visual graphics for Secret Cinema’s “Prometheus” show.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, my interest in live performance led me to co-create <a href="http://velvettrumpet.co.uk" target="_blank">Velvet Trumpet</a>, a theatre company in which I am Production Manager. I was thrilled to be at the helm of their first production “A Model Life”, which ran at The Network Theatre to rave reviews. Velvet Trumpet's latest production 'Don't Disturb the Driver' was featured at the 2013 Edinburgh Fringe, and we now hope to hold regular nights at the Hen &amp; Chickens Theatre Pub with our first show being "Toast".

              I reflect my role in Framestore as a generalist. Primarily I focus on web development. This role is self managed and In some cases I have employed team members to help on larger projects and managed them. Through Framestore i was able to apply for a vacancy Rathergood where hiring for. The budget was low and expectations were high as the Rathergood’s first feature length film starred the voice talents of Steve Coogan as narrator, plus Julian Barratt and Julia Davis. It was an exciting project and I approached each day with a smile, even around my day job. I recruited an After Effects freelancer to help out in which I personally managed. We achieved everything beyond expectation and the client was very happy.
