      <p>
        I am an experienced digital media design and production professional currently working as an interface developer for Digital Detox, a Web Development company based in London. Primarily using HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT for key clients, such as Vodafone and Cancer Research UK.

            Before this, for three years I leveraged and honed my technical expertise using Adobe CS and Developer skills (HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, Actionscript) on key projects at Framestore in their design and digital portfolio. A rewarding experience spanning interactive, VFX, motion graphics, titles and credits, and motion capture. Highlights include building British Airways’ “Take a Plane Down Your Street” web/Facebook app, which has been said to be <q cite="Mail%20On%20Sunday,%2023%20June%202012">The most successful social media app ever</q> (Mail On Sunday, 23 June 2012), titles and end rollers for the film “Tyrannosaur”, and working on visual graphics for Secret Cinema’s “Prometheus” show.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, my interest in live performance led me to co-create Velvet Trumpet, a theatre company in which I am Production Manager. I was thrilled to be at the helm of their first production “A Model Life”, which ran at The Network Theatre to rave reviews. Velvet Trumpet's latest production 'Don't Disturb the Driver' was featured at the 2013 Edinburgh Fringe, and we now hope to hold regular nights at the Hen &amp; Chickens Theatre Pub with our first show being "Toast".

              I reflect my role in Framestore as a generalist. Primarily I focus on web development. This role is self managed and In some cases I have employed team members to help on larger projects and managed them. Through Framestore i was able to apply for a vacancy Rathergood where hiring for. The budget was low and expectations were high as the Rathergood’s first feature length film starred the voice talents of Steve Coogan as narrator, plus Julian Barratt and Julia Davis. It was an exciting project and I approached each day with a smile, even around my day job. I recruited an After Effects freelancer to help out in which I personally managed. We achieved everything beyond expectation and the client was very happy.
