          Hi there,
          <p>
            I’m an experienced digital media developer specialising in HTML, CSS and Javascript but with a broad knowledge in many disciplines. 
            From 2009 to 2012 leveraged and honed these skills on key projects within 
            <a href="http://www.framestore.com" target="_blank">Framestore’s</a> design and digital portfolio. 
            It has been a hugely rewarding experience spanning interactive, VFX, motion graphics, titles and credits.
          <p>
          <p>
            In addition to my work at Framestore, my interest in live performance which i achieved from being lead vocalist and guitarist in my band led me to co-create 
            <a href="http://www.velvettrumpet.co.uk" title="Velvet Trumpet Theatre" target="_blank">Velvet Trumpet</a>, a theatre company in which I am Production Manager. 
            I was thrilled to be at the helm of our first production “A Model Life”, which ran at The Network Theatre to rave reviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            I combine technical aptitude with practicality and a client-driven, results-oriented approach. 
            I enjoy the challenge of innovating and delighting my clients, while working within the realities of time and financial considerations.

              <i>Production Manager</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              Founded this year, Velvet Trumpet is an “extracurricular” project where I have utilised the project management skills I have acquired in the course of my “day job”. 
              I am responsible for organising rehearsal and performance space, managing company finances and fundraising, workshop management, liaison with suppliers and partners, live production. 
              Because of my vast list of contacts I have gained as clients and work colleagues I aim to get things done as inexpensive as possible. 
              I also aim to recruit people with a genuine love of what they do, hoping to provide them with a great line on their CV and future liaison. 
              Velvet Trumpet also expand into comedy sketches in-which I organise and gather equipment to film and record audio with. 
              I also arrange location, dates and times where actors and technical staff are required, as well as the post production if necessary. 
              Such as VFX, sound, and editing.

              <h3>Freelancer</h3> 2009 - Present
            </p>
            <p>
              I reflect my role in Framestore as a generalist. Primarily I focus on web development. 
              This role is self managed and In some cases I have employed team members to help on larger projects and managed them. 
              Through Framestore i was able to apply for a vacancy Rathergood where hiring for. 
              The budget was low and expectations were high as the Rathergood’s first feature length film starred the voice talents of Steve Coogan as narrator, 
              plus Julian Barratt and Julia Davis. It was an exciting project and I approached each day with a smile, even around my day job. 
              I recruited an After Effects freelancer to help out in which I personally managed. We achieved everything beyond expectation and the client was very happy.
